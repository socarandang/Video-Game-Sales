# Video-Game-Sales

This file contains visuals created using Power BI. The data set was acquired through Kaggle under "sales".

The main purpose of this project was to:

1) Get acquainted with Power BI and Bravo
2) Practice data cleaning and transforming
3) Creating visuals, analyzing, and making thoughtful conclusions from the data

Credits go to Pedro Israel, from Kaggle, for creating a tutorial on this project.
